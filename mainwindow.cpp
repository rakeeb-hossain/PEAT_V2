It is provided to facilitate the analysis of web\nand computer content to help identify those materials which are a\nrisk for causing seizures in individuals with photosensitive seizure\ndisorders including epilepsy.  This tool is based on and uses the\nanalysis engine from the Harding Flash and Pattern Analysis Tool\nfor television programming developed by Cambridge Research\nSystems in conjunction with Dr. Graham Harding.  In this Trace\nCenter tool the underlying engine has been adapted by the Trace\nCenter in conjunction with Dr. Harding and Cambridge Research\nSystems so that it is applicable to computer software and web\ncontent.\n\nThis tool is designed to provide a software and web site analysis\ntool for use by web and computer software designers, evaluators\nand users to test for sequences considered provocative to\nphotosensitive individuals.  This tool may be used freely for these\npurposes.  This tool may NOT be used to assess material\ncommercially produced for the television broadcast, film, or home\nentertainment or gaming industries.
